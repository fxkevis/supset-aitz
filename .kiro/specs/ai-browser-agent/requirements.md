# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An AI-powered browser automation agent that autonomously controls a web browser to perform complex multi-step tasks. The agent operates in Python with visible browser control, uses AI models available in the Russian Federation, and can handle tasks like email management, online ordering, and web navigation with minimal user intervention.

## Glossary

- **AI_Agent**: The autonomous system that controls browser actions and makes decisions
- **Browser_Controller**: The component that programmatically controls the web browser
- **Task_Manager**: The system that processes and executes multi-step user tasks
- **Context_Manager**: The component that manages AI token limitations when processing web content
- **Security_Layer**: The safety mechanism that prompts users before destructive actions
- **User_Interface**: The communication channel between user and AI_Agent (terminal or separate window)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit complex multi-step tasks to an AI agent, so that I can automate repetitive browser-based workflows without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a task description, THE AI_Agent SHALL parse the task and create an execution plan
2. WHILE executing a task, THE AI_Agent SHALL operate autonomously without requiring constant user input
3. IF the AI_Agent encounters uncertainty during task execution, THEN THE AI_Agent SHALL request clarification from the user
4. THE AI_Agent SHALL provide status updates and final reports upon task completion
5. WHERE a task involves multiple steps, THE AI_Agent SHALL handle page transitions and maintain context between steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to control a visible web browser, so that I can observe the automation process and maintain trust in the system's actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Browser_Controller SHALL operate in visible mode rather than headless mode
2. THE Browser_Controller SHALL support persistent browser sessions for user authentication
3. WHEN a user manually logs into a service, THE Browser_Controller SHALL maintain that session for subsequent automated tasks
4. THE Browser_Controller SHALL provide programmatic control over browser navigation, clicking, and form filling
5. THE Browser_Controller SHALL handle dynamic web content and JavaScript-rendered pages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to use AI models available in Russia, so that the system complies with regional requirements and accessibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Agent SHALL integrate with Claude or OpenAI models accessible in the Russian Federation
2. THE AI_Agent SHALL make autonomous decisions based on web page content and user instructions
3. THE AI_Agent SHALL analyze web elements to determine appropriate actions for task completion
4. THE AI_Agent SHALL adapt its behavior based on different website layouts and structures
5. THE AI_Agent SHALL maintain decision-making capabilities across various web domains

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large web pages efficiently, so that token limitations don't prevent task completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Context_Manager SHALL implement strategies to work within AI model token restrictions
2. THE Context_Manager SHALL extract relevant content from web pages rather than sending entire page content
3. THE Context_Manager SHALL prioritize important page elements based on the current task context
4. THE Context_Manager SHALL maintain task context across multiple page interactions
5. THE Context_Manager SHALL optimize content summarization for AI processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to handle email management tasks, so that I can automate spam detection and inbox organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasked with email management, THE AI_Agent SHALL navigate to the specified email service
2. THE AI_Agent SHALL read email metadata including subject, sender, and content summaries
3. THE AI_Agent SHALL analyze emails to identify spam based on content patterns and sender reputation
4. THE AI_Agent SHALL perform email actions such as deletion, marking as spam, or moving to folders
5. THE AI_Agent SHALL provide detailed reports of actions taken and emails processed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to handle online ordering tasks, so that I can automate food delivery and shopping workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasked with online ordering, THE AI_Agent SHALL navigate to the appropriate e-commerce or delivery website
2. THE AI_Agent SHALL search for and identify specific products based on user descriptions
3. THE AI_Agent SHALL add correct items to shopping carts while distinguishing between similar products
4. THE AI_Agent SHALL proceed through checkout processes up to payment confirmation
5. THE AI_Agent SHALL reference previous order history when available to replicate past purchases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to include safety measures, so that destructive actions require my explicit approval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the AI_Agent encounters a potentially destructive action, THEN THE Security_Layer SHALL prompt the user for confirmation
2. THE Security_Layer SHALL identify actions such as payments, deletions, or account modifications as requiring approval
3. THE Security_Layer SHALL pause task execution until user confirmation is received for destructive actions
4. THE Security_Layer SHALL allow users to configure which actions require confirmation
5. THE Security_Layer SHALL log all security prompts and user responses for audit purposes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to communicate with the agent through a user-friendly interface, so that I can easily submit tasks and receive updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface SHALL provide a communication channel through terminal or separate window
2. THE User_Interface SHALL accept natural language task descriptions from users
3. THE User_Interface SHALL display real-time status updates during task execution
4. THE User_Interface SHALL present clear prompts when user input is required
5. THE User_Interface SHALL format task completion reports in a readable manner
